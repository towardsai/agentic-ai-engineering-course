# AI Agents Course from Towards AI and Decoding AI

This repository contains all the code exercises and project materials for the **AI Agents** course, created by **Towards AI** and **Decoding AI**. This course is designed for developers who want to move beyond basic LLM tutorials and build production-grade AI agents and workflows. It provides a hands-on, project-based approach to learning agentic architecture patterns, modern frameworks like LangGraph, and essential production skills like LLMOps, evaluation, and deployment.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help you easily find and follow along with the course materials.

  - **`lessons/`**: This directory contains all the code notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for the course lessons. Each lesson has its own folder (e.g., `01_ai_agents_landscape/`).
  - **`utils/`**: Helper scripts and utility functions used in the notebooks.
  - **`.env.example`**: A template file for your environment variables.
  - **`pyproject.toml`**: The main configuration file for project dependencies.
  - **`uv.lock`**: A lock file generated by `uv` to ensure a reproducible environment.

> For instructions on running the **Nova research agent** from the terminal (MCP server + client), see the dedicated README in `lessons/research_agent_part_2/README.md`.

### Getting Started: Running the Notebooks

To run the course notebooks, you'll need to set up your local environment. Follow these steps to get everything installed and configured.

#### 1\. Install Git and `uv`

First, make sure you have **Git** and the **`uv`** package manager installed.

  - [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): This is used to clone the repository.
  - [**`uv`**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): A modern, high-speed Python package manager that will handle all dependencies for this project.

#### 2\. Clone the Repository

Clone the course repository as described in the admin lesson of the course. It uses a fine-grained GitHub token to provide read-only access to its contents.

#### 3\. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Navigate into the cloned repository's root directory and run `uv sync --group dev`. This will create a virtual environment (`.venv` folder) and install all the necessary packages defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
cd course-ai-agents
uv sync --group dev
```

#### 4\. Configure Your API Key

The course notebooks use Google's Gemini models. To use them, you'll need to get a free API key from Google AI Studio.

1.  Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
2.  Open the new `.env` file and replace the placeholder text with your actual `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

#### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebooks

The code exercises are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files). You can run them using the classic browser interface or a modern code editor like VS Code.

**Option A: Run in your Web Browser**

1.  First, create a Jupyter kernel that points to your new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    uv run ipython kernel install --user --name="ai-agents-course"
    ```
2.  Launch the Jupyter Notebook interface:
    ```bash
    uv run jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  This will open a new tab in your browser. Navigate to a lesson's notebook file.
4.  Once the notebook is open, click on **Kernel > Change kernel** in the top menu and select `"ai-agents-course"` from the list.

**Option B: Run in VS Code**

1.  Make sure you have the official [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed from the marketplace.
2.  Open the `course-ai-agents` project folder in VS Code.
3.  Open any `notebook.ipynb` file from the `lessons` directory.
4.  Click on the **“Select Kernel”** button in the top-right of the editor.
5.  Choose **“Python Environments”** from the list of options.
6.  Select the virtual environment from the cloned repository, which will be located at `.venv/bin/python`.

You are now ready to run the code cells in the notebook

### Running the Research Agent and Writing Workflow as Independent Projects

Along with the Jupyter Notebook lessons you can also run the research agent and writing workflow as independent projects.

You can find specialized documentation on how to install and run each project at:

| Project | Description | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Nova Research Agent** | Research agent used in part 2. | [`lessons/research_agent_part_2/README.md`](lessons/research_agent_part_2/README.md) |
| **Brown Writing Workflow** | All the code for the writing workflow. | [`lessons/writing_workflow/README.md`](lessons/writing_workflow/README.md) |
