In this lesson, we will explore how to use both the Nova research agent and the Brown writing workflow together by leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we dive into the technical implementation, let's understand the orchestration model we're using and why it matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Central LLM Orchestration Pattern\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we're implementing what's known as a **Central LLM Orchestration** pattern. In this approach, a single, central LLM (e.g. the one powering your IDE assistant, like Claude in Cursor) has access to tools from multiple specialized agents. When you give it a task, the LLM dynamically decides which agent's tools to use based on the task requirements, maintaining a single conversation context and orchestrating the workflow by selecting the appropriate tools as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is fundamentally different from other orchestration patterns. A **Supervisor Agent** pattern would have one agent explicitly delegate entire sub-tasks to worker agents. A **Sequential Pipeline** would force agents to always execute in a fixed order. **Peer-to-Peer Communication** would allow agents to directly message each other. Our central LLM orchestration is simpler: the LLM acts as a intelligent tool selector rather than an explicit coordinator.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll learn more about these other patterns in another lesson.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Pattern Works Well with MCP\n",
        "\n",
        "The Model Context Protocol makes this orchestration pattern particularly elegant. Both Nova and Brown expose their capabilities as MCP tools with clear descriptions, allowing the central LLM to discover all available tools through a single, standardized protocol. This unified tool interface eliminates the need for custom integration code: because both agents speak MCP, we don't need to write adapters or APIs. The client simply connects to both servers and aggregates their tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM's natural reasoning ability handles the orchestration logic. For example, it intuitively understands that it should use Nova's research tools first, review the results, and then use Brown's writing tools with that research as input. There's no need to explicitly program this workflow or create complex state machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "The flexibility is another key advantage. You can easily add or remove agents by simply updating the configuration file without touching any code. This pattern essentially treats specialized agents as \"tool libraries\" that a central reasoning engine can draw from as needed, making the system both modular and maintainable."

      "source": [
        "### The Rationale: Why Choose Central LLM Orchestration?\n",
        "\n",
        "This orchestration pattern offers several compelling advantages that make it ideal for our use case of integrating Nova and Brown.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most immediate benefit is **simplicity and maintainability**. All decision-making happens in one place—the central LLM, which means the workflow is transparent and easy to understand. You can see which tools the LLM chooses in real-time as it works through a task. There's no need for complex state management or inter-agent communication protocols, which reduces the cognitive overhead of understanding and debugging the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pattern also enables **natural task decomposition**. The central LLM can break down complex requests on the fly without requiring predefined workflows. Even more importantly, it can adapt its strategy based on intermediate results. For example, if research reveals unexpected information, the LLM can adjust its writing approach accordingly. This adaptive behavior is especially valuable for human-in-the-loop workflows common in IDE environments. You can provide feedback at any point in the process, and the LLM incorporates it naturally without requiring explicit handoff protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "The central LLM maintains a **single, unified context window**, which means it can reference information from Nova's research when calling Brown's tools without requiring explicit data passing between agents. This avoids the notorious \"siloed knowledge\" problem, where critical information gets trapped in one agent's context and becomes unavailable to others who need it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps most importantly for our specific use case, this pattern is **perfect for sequential, interdependent tasks**. Our workflow (research followed by writing) is inherently sequential, and the writing task depends heavily on research results. A central orchestrator can easily manage these dependencies because it sees the entire workflow and can make informed decisions about when to transition from research to writing."

        "### The Tradeoffs: Understanding the Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "While central LLM orchestration with MCP is powerful, it's important to understand its limitations and recognize when you might need a different approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first limitation arises from **tool overload**. As the number of available tools grows beyond approximately 15-20, LLMs begin to struggle with reliable tool selection. They may choose suboptimal tools or miss relevant ones entirely. This degradation in performance is well-documented in the research on agent systems. Our system, with 14 tools total, is comfortably within the limit, but if you were to add many more specialized agents, you'd eventually hit this ceiling and need to consider a different pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another significant limitation is the pattern's inherently **sequential execution model**. If you need to research 50 companies simultaneously, a single LLM executing tools one at a time would be painfully inefficient. In such scenarios, a Supervisor-Worker pattern with parallel execution would be better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pattern also struggles with **complex inter-agent dependencies**. If agents need to negotiate with each other, engage in debate, or iteratively refine each other's work through back-and-forth exchanges, direct agent-to-agent communication would be more natural. Our pattern handles simple, linear dependencies well (Nova's output feeds into Brown) but complex multi-way interactions would become awkward and difficult to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, central LLM orchestration with MCP is the **right default choice** for most agent integration scenarios. It's simple, maintainable, and leverages the LLM's natural reasoning abilities without adding unnecessary complexity. You should only consider more elaborate patterns when you hit clear scaling limits (e.g. too many tools causing selection problems) or have fundamentally different requirements like massive parallelism or complex agent negotiations.\n",

        "In the previous lessons, we built two specialized agents: Nova for research (which ingests article guidelines, performs web research, scrapes sources, and compiles comprehensive research files) and Brown for writing (which takes research and guidelines to generate, review, and edit articles with human-in-the-loop feedback). These agents were designed to work in sequence—Nova gathers the research, and Brown uses that research to write the article—but we've been running them separately. Now we'll orchestrate them together using the central LLM orchestration pattern. Because both agents are already exposed as MCP servers, integration is straightforward: we simply connect to both servers and let the central LLM decide which tools to use and when.\n",

        "We'll explore two different approaches for achieving this integration.\n",

        "3. After mounting both servers, we add a new capability: the `full_research_and_writing_workflow` prompt. This is the key advantage of the composed server approach—we can add orchestration logic that coordinates both agents without modifying either agent's code. The `@mcp.prompt()` decorator registers a new MCP prompt that combines instructions for both Nova's research workflow and Brown's article generation. When a user triggers this prompt, the LLM receives comprehensive instructions to run both agents end-to-end in a single conversation."

        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we explored how to integrate the Nova research agent and Brown writing workflow using MCP. We learned:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Multi-Server MCP Client**: How to connect a single client to multiple MCP servers using FastMCP's multi-server configuration. Capabilities are prefixed with server names, and you run agent workflows by triggering their prompts sequentially.\n",
        "2. **Composed MCP Server**: How to use FastMCP's composition features (`as_proxy()` and `mount()`) to create a unified server that proxies multiple agents. Crucially, composed servers can add new orchestration prompts—like `full_research_and_writing_workflow`—that coordinate multiple agents without modifying their code.\n",
        "3. **Use Cases**: When to use multi-server client vs composed server. The multi-server approach is better for flexibility and independence, while the composed server is better for having a unified interface, orchestration capabilities, and single-command workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that MCP makes agent integration straightforward. Because both Nova and Brown are already MCP servers, we don't need to write custom integration code. We simply leverage MCP's standardized protocol and FastMCP's composition features. The composed server approach goes further by allowing us to add orchestration logic at the integration layer—providing a single-command interface to run both agents end-to-end—without polluting either agent's codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a real-world scenario, you would use these integrated agents within an IDE like Cursor. You could:\n",
        "- Configure the composed server in Cursor's MCP settings\n",
        "- Trigger the `full_research_and_writing_workflow` prompt with a single command\n",
        "- Watch as the LLM automatically orchestrates Nova's research and Brown's article generation\n",
        "- Review the research file and generated article\n",
        "- Iterate on the article with Brown's editing tools\n",
        "- All from within your editor, with beautiful diff views and human-in-the-loop feedback\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next lesson, you'll see how to use both agents from Cursor to work on an article end-to-end. In Part 3 of this course, we'll explore production deployment, including how to deploy these composed servers remotely, add monitoring with Opik, and implement security measures."
