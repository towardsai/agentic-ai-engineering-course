## Global Context of the Lesson

### What We Are Planning to Share

...

### Why We Think It's Valuable

...

### Expected Length of the Lesson

**<x> words** (without the titles and references), where we assume that 200-250 words ≈ 1 minute of reading time.

### Theory / Practice Ratio

<x>% theory - <y% real-world examples

## Achoring the Lesson in the Course

### Point of View
The course is created by a team writing for a single reader, also known as the student. Thus, for voice consistency across the course, we will always use 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' to refer to the team who creates the course, and 'you' or 'your' to address the reader. Avoid singular first person and don't use 'we' to refer to the student.

Examples of correct point of view:
- Instead of "Before we can choose between workflows and agents, we need a clear understanding of what they are." word it as "To choose between workflows and agents, you need a clear understanding of what they are."

### Lesson Scope

This is the <x> lesson from module <y> of a broader course on AI agents and LLM workflows.

### Who Is the Intended Audience

Aspiring AI engineers who are learning about <x> for the first time.

### Concepts Introduced in Previous Lessons

<ADAPT BASED ON YOUR CURRENT LESSON>

In previous lessons, we introduced the following concepts:
- What AI agents are at a high-level (NOT how they work) (Lesson 2)
- What LLM workflows are at a high-level (NOT how they work) (Lesson 2)
- How to choose between AI agents and LLM workflows when designing your AI application (Lesson 2)

As this is only the <x> lesson of the course, we haven't introduced too many concepts. At this point, the reader only knows what an LLM is and a few high-level ideas about the LLM workflows and AI agents landscape.

### Concepts That Will Be Introduced in Future Lessons

<ADAPT BASED ON YOUR CURRENT LESSON>

In future lessons of the course, we will introduce the following concepts:
- structured outputs (Lesson 4)
- chaining (Lesson 5)
- routing (Lesson 5)
- orchestrator-worker (Lesson 5)
- tools (Lesson 6)
- ReAct agents (Lesson 7 and 8)
- Plan-and-Execute agents (Lesson 7)
- short-term memory (Lesson 9)
- long-term memory (Lesson 9)
    - procedural long-term memory
    - semantic long-term memory
    - episodic long-term memory
- RAG (Lesson 10)
- multimodal LLMs (Lesson 11)
- evaluations
- MCP

As <x> is the core foundation of AI engineering, we will have to introduce new terms, but we will discuss them in a highly intuitive manner, being careful not to confuse the reader with too many terms that haven't been introduced yet in the course.

### Course Instructions
When discussing the **concepts introduced in previous lessons** listed in the `Concepts Introduced in Previous Lessons` section, avoid reintroducing them to the reader. Especially don't reintroduce the acronyms. Use them as if the reader already knows what they are. 

Avoid using all the **concepts that haven't been introduced in previous lessons** listed in the `Concepts That Will Be Introduced in Future Lessons` subsection. Whenever another concept requires references to these banned concepts, instead of directly using it, use other intuitive and grounded explanations as you would explain them to a 7-year-old. For example:
- If the "tools" concept wasn't introduced yet and you have to talk about agents, refer them to as "actions".
- If the "routing" concept wasn't introduced yet and you have to talk about it, refer it to as "guiding the workflow between multiple decisions".
You can use the concepts that haven't been introduced in previous lessons listed in the `Concepts That Will Be Introduced in Future Lessons` subsection, only if we explicitly specify them. Still, even in that case, as the reader doesn't know how that concept works, you are just allowed to use the term, while keeping the explanation extremely high-level and intuitive, as if you were explaining it to a 7-year-old.
Whenever you use a concept from the `Concepts That Will Be Introduced in Future Lessons` subsection explicitly specify that it will be explained in more detail in future lessons.

In all use cases avoid using acronyms that aren't explicitly stated in the guidelines. Rather use other more accessible synonyms or descriptions that are easier to understand by non-experts.

## Narrative Flow of the Lesson

Follow the next narrative flow when writing the end-to-end lesson:

- What problem are we solving? Why is it essential to solve it?
    - Start with a personal story where we encountered the problem
- Why other solutions are not working and what's wrong with them.
- At a theoretical level, explain our solution or transformation. Highlight:
    - The theoretical foundations.
    - Why is it better than other solutions?
    - What tools or algorithms can we use?
- Provide some hands-on examples.
- Go deeper into the advanced theory.
- Provide a more complex example supporting the advanced theory.
- Connect our solution to the bigger picture and next steps.
