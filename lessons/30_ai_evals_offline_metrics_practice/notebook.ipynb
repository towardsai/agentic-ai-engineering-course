    "\n",
    "### The Evaluation Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in Lesson 28, we created an evaluation dataset where each sample contains:\n",
    "- **Article Guideline**: The user intent describing how the article should look\n",
    "- **Research**: The source material the article should be based on  \n",
    "- **Expected Article (Ground Truth)**: The reference article to compare against\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that **the generated article is computed on the fly**. Every time we make changes to our AI app (Brown), we regenerate the articles and recompute the metrics. This is why everything else is static—we only vary the generated outputs and system parameters during optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will build two complementary LLM judge metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FollowsGT (Follows Ground Truth)**: Compares the **generated article** with the **expected article** across three dimensions:\n",
    "   - **Content**: Does the generated section cover the same topics and ideas?\n",
    "   - **Flow**: Does it follow the same order of ideas and transitions?\n",
    "   - **Structure**: Does it use the same formatting patterns (headers, lists, code blocks)?\n",

    "2. **UserIntent**: Compares the **generated article** with the **input** (article guideline and research) across two dimensions:\n",
    "   - **Guideline Adherence**: Does the generated article follow the specific requirements from the article guideline?\n",
    "   - **Research Anchoring**: Is the content based solely on the provided research, or does it hallucinate?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section-Level Binary Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LLM judges use **binary metrics scoped at the section level** instead of the whole article level. For each article, we compute all the metrics from above (content, flow, structure, guideline adherencem research anchoring) for each section individually.\n",

    "You are an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP) evaluation metrics, specifically trained to \n",

    "Your task is to evaluate the quality of a generated article by another LLM relative to \n",

    "**2. Scoring Instructions** - Section-level binary scoring across the content, flow and structure dimensions. Note how detailed we defined each step of the LLM judge on how to use the expected and generated outputs, plus how to reason about the output business metrics:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "## INSTRUCTIONS \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You must analyze the given expected article (<expected_output>) and generated article (<generated_output>) \n",
    "to determine the most relevant evaluation.\n",
    "2. Since the generated output is an answer from another LLM, you must use the expected output as the reference \n",
    "standard to compare and evaluate the quality of the generated output.\n",
    "3. Both the generated and expected outputs are in Markdown format.\n",
    "4. Instead of comparing the outputs as a whole, you will divide the outputs into sections and compare each section \n",
    "individually. \n",
    "5. You will always use the expected output as the reference point to extract the sections of interest during the\n",
    "evaluation. If there is no perfect match between the expected and generated section names, first try to infer\n",
    "the corresponding section based on the similarity of section names and their respective content. If you conclude that \n",
    "the expected output contains a section that the generated output lacks, you will assign a score of 0 to the missing \n",
    "section in the generated output.\n",
    "6. Sections are divided by H2 headers, marked as \"##\" in Markdown. You will use these headers as \n",
    "separators. Anything between two H2 headers constitutes a section. The only valid exception to this rule is the first \n",
    "section, the introduction, which sometimes appears between the title and the first H2 header. You will never include \n",
    "the title or subtitle as part of the first section.\n",
    "7. When comparing each individual section of the expected output to the generated output, you will assign a binary \n",
    "score for multiple criteria: 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a non-match and 1 indicates a perfect match. Each criterion\n",
    "is completely independent of the others, meaning that a score of 0 in one criterion does not affect the score of \n",
    "another criterion.\n",
    "8. You must compute binary scores for each section based on the following criteria:\n",
    "  1. **Content:** Evaluate whether the generated section covers the same content as the expected section:\n",
    "    - Focus only on evaluating that the substance of the content is the same between the expected and generated section. By content, we \n",
    "    mean core subjects, topics, research, ideas, key points or arguments. For example, if both sections discuss the\n",
    "    fundamentals of RAG, it's valid. But, if the expected section discusses advanced RAG topics, while the generated section\n",
    "    discusses basic RAG topics, it's invalid.\n",
    "    - In this criterion, we are not interested in the order, structure, layout, or any other aspect related to the flow of\n",
    "    ideas, structure or mechanics. For example, if there are missing or additional ideas discussed it's still valid, as\n",
    "    long as the substance of the content between the expected and generated section is the same.\n",
    "  2. **Flow:** Evaluate whether the generated section follows the same order of ideas as the expected section, such as \n",
    "  the flow of:\n",
    "    - Main ideas covered starting with the beginning, until the end of the section. With special emphasis on the beginning and end of the \n",
    "    section as they reflect the transition between the previous and next sections\n",
    "    - Internal transitions between the main points within the section. We expect a smooth flow of ideas, \n",
    "    without any abrupt jumps or breaks.\n",
    "    - Placement of notes, images, tables, code blocks, or any other media elements within the generated section, \n",
    "    relative to the expected section. \n",
    "    - We don't expect a perfect one on one match between the paragraphs and sentences between the expected and generated section.\n",
    "    However, we expect the same ideas and concepts to be discussed in the same way, order, and storyline.\n",
    "    - Assign a score of 0 if anything is missing from the generated section relative to the expected section, such as missing\n",
    "    topics, ideas, or media.\n",
    "    - Assign a score of 0 if anything is additionally added to the generated section relative to the expected section, such \n",
    "    as additional topics, ideas or media elements.\n",
    "    - Accepted differences between the expected and generated section:\n",
    "        - Mismatching media numbering is accepted. For example, if in the expected section we have a figure with the number 3 and\n",
    "        in the generated section we have a figure with the number 4, it's valid. It will be invalid, only if the figure would be\n",
    "        missing altogether.\n",
    "        - Mismatching or missing emojis. For example, if the excepted section has a 💡 emoji, while the generated section has \n",
    "        a 🔑 emoji, it's valid. Also, if the emoji is missing altogether from the generated section, it's valid.\n",
    "        - Mismatching source reference numbers. For example, if the expected section referes a source with the number 3, \n",
    "        while the generated section referes a source with the number 7, it's valid. It will be invalid, only if the generated\n",
    "        section misses the source altogether. \n",
    "        - Different placement of the source in the generated section. For example, if the expected section has the source\n",
    "        at the end of a sentence within the paragraph, while the generated section has it at the end of the paragraph, it's valid. \n",
    "        It will be invalid, only if the generated section would be missing altogether.\n",
    "        - Mismatching number of source references. For example, if the expected section has 3 source references, while the \n",
    "        generated section has 2 source references, it's valid. It will be invalid, only if the generated section would have \n",
    "        misses the references altogether. For example if the expected section has 3 source references, while the generated \n",
    "        section has 0 source references, it's invalid.\n",
    "        - Having reference numbers in the generated section, while having none in the expected section. For example, if the \n",
    "        expected section has 0 reference numbers, while the generated section has 3 reference number, it's valid. It will be \n",
    "        invalid, only the other way around, where the expected section has 3 reference numbers, while the generated section has 0.\n",
    "  3. **Structure:** Evaluate whether the generated section follows the same structure as the expected section. By \n",
    "  structure, we mean:\n",
    "    - H3/H4/H5/H6 sub-heading structure and formatting\n",
    "    - Mismatches in headers formatting and presence. For example, if the expected section doesn't has a header,\n",
    "    while the generated section has one, it's invalid. It's valid only if there is a one on one match between the headers\n",
    "    formatting and presence.\n",
    "    - Use of bulleted lists, numbered lists, callouts, notes, or other layout elements\n",
    "    - Division of the section when guiding readers through code blocks or diagrams\n",
    "    - Formatting of notes and code blocks\n",
    "    - Use of bolding, italicizing, quotes, backticks, or other formatting elements\n",
    "    - Formatting of citation references across sentences\n",
    "    - Formatting of images, tables, and Mermaid diagrams and their corresponding citations. If they are missing from\n",
    "    the generated section, we consider it valid for this criterion, as we are interested ONLY in formatting, which we\n",
    "    cannot verify when elements are absent. For this criterion, missing elements from the generated sections are \n",
    "    considered valid. They are invalid only if present in both sections but formatted differently.\n",
    "    - Number formatting conventions\n",
    "9. Along with the binary scores, you will provide a brief and concise explanation containing the reasoning behind \n",
    "the score for each criterion. The score will be used to debug and monitor the evaluation process. Therefore, it is\n",
    "important to provide thorough reasoning for the score. Since we provide binary scores, the reasoning should always \n",
    "contain what is good and what is problematic about the generated section, regardless of the score. For example, if the \n",
    "score is 0, the reasoning should also contain what is good about the generated section, such as \"both sections \n",
    "follow the same flow of ideas,\" and what is problematic, such as \"the generated section contains an additional \n",
    "paragraph on AI Evals that is not present in the expected section.\"\n",
    "10. Important rules when comparing the content of sections:\n",
    "    - Focus on substance, not superficial formatting differences\n",
    "    - When comparing **media**, you only care about the placement of the media, not the content of the media. \n",
    "    Since media can take many forms such as Mermaid diagrams, tables, images, or URLs, you will completely ignore the \n",
    "    content of the media and only check whether the media is present in the correct place in the section, has \n",
    "    the appropriate citation, and proper numbering.\n",

      "  2. **Flow:** Evaluate whether the generated section follows the same order of ideas as the expected section, such as \n",
      "  the flow of:\n",
      "    - Main ideas covered starting with the beginning, until the end of the section. With special emphasis on the beginning and end of the \n",

      "    - Internal transitions between the main points within the section. We expect a smooth flow of ideas, \n",

      "    - Placement of notes, images, tables, code blocks, or any other media elements within the generated section, \n",
      "    relative to the expected section. \n",
      "    - We don't expect a perfect one on one match between the paragraphs and sentences between the expected and generated section.\n",
      "    However, we expect the same ideas and concepts to be discussed in the same way, order, and storyline.\n",
      "    - Assign a score of 0 if anything is missing from the generated section relative to the expected section, such as missing\n",

      "    - H3/H4/H5/H6 sub-heading structure and formatting\n",

      "When building AI applications, engineers face a critical architectural decision early on. Should you create a predictable, step-by-step workflow where you control every action, or build an autonomous agent that can think and decide for itself? This choice impacts everything from development time and cost to reliability and user experience. It is a fundamental decision that often determines if an AI application will be successful in production.\n",

      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks orchestrated by developer-written code. It can include LLM calls, but also other operations like reading from a database or calling an API. Think of it like a recipe where each step is explicitly defined. The key characteristic is that the path is determined in advance, resulting in a deterministic or rule-based system. This gives you predictable execution, explicit control over the application's flow, and makes the system easier to test and debug. Because you control every step, you know exactly where a failure occurred and how to fix it.\n",

      "AI agents are systems where an LLM dynamically decides the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The path is not predefined. Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

Their strength is flexibility in handling ambiguity. However, this autonomy makes them less reliable, harder to debug, and costlier due to non-deterministic behavior. Without proper guardrails, they also pose security risks, especially with operations that can modify or delete data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hybrid Approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Most real-world systems are not purely one or the other. They often blend elements of both, creating a hybrid system. A common pattern is to use a workflow for predictable parts of a task and delegate ambiguous steps to an agent. For example, a system might use a human-in-the-loop workflow, where the agent proposes an action, and a human verifies it before execution.\n",

This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "- **When to use LLM workflows:** Workflows are ideal for repeatable tasks with defined steps, like data extraction, report generation, or content repurposing. Their strength is predictability, ensuring reliable results, easier debugging, and lower costs by using specialized models. The main weakness is rigidity; they cannot handle unexpected scenarios, and adding features can become complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **When to use AI agents:** Agents excel at dynamic problem-solving like open-ended research or complex customer support [[3]](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-developers-guide-to-building-scalable-ai-workflows-vs-agents/). Their strength is flexibility in handling ambiguity. However, this autonomy makes them less reliable, harder to debug, and costlier due to non-deterministic behavior. Without proper guardrails, they also pose security risks, especially with operations that can modify or delete data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Most real-world systems are not purely one or the other. They often blend elements of both, creating a hybrid system. A common pattern is to use a workflow for predictable parts of a task and delegate ambiguous steps to an agent. For example, a system might use a human-in-the-loop workflow, where the agent proposes an action, and a human verifies it before execution.\n",

    "## INSTRUCTIONS \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You must analyze the given article guideline (<input>), research material (<context>), and \n",
    "generated article (<output>) to determine how well the output follows the input guidelines and utilizes the research.\n",
    "2. The input, context, and output are in Markdown format.\n",
    "3. Instead of comparing the outputs as a whole, you will divide the outputs into sections and compare each section \n",
    "individually. \n",
    "4. Since the article guideline reflects the user expectations and intent, you will always use it as the reference point \n",
    "to understand which sections from the generated article should be evaluated. To find the expected sections, look within \n",
    "the given article guideline for the keyword \"Outline\" or actual section titles often marked with H2 headers prefixed\n",
    "with \"Section\". You will always use these as the anchor points, the expected sections, when making comparisons between\n",
    "sections. \n",
    "5. When associating a section from the article guideline with one from the generated article, you will first look\n",
    "for a matching or similar title. If there is no match based solely on the title, you will try to make associations based\n",
    "on the content of the section. For example, if the expected section has 3 points on how RAG works and\n",
    "the generated section has 3 points on how RAG works as well, then they are associated even if the titles are different.\n",
    "If a required section mentioned in the guideline is missing from the generated article, you will assign a score of \n",
    "0 to all evaluation criteria.\n",
    "6. Using the article guideline as an anchor, you will divide the generated article into sections and evaluate each section \n",
    "individually against all given criteria.\n",
    "7. Sections are divided by H2 headers, marked as \"##\" in Markdown. You will use the headers as separators. \n",
    "Anything between two H2 headers constitutes a section. The only valid exception to this rule is the first section, \n",
    "the introduction, which sometimes appears between the title and the first H2 header. You will never include the title or \n",
    "subtitle as part of the first section.\n",
    "8. The score can only be an integer value of 0 or 1. For each section, you will assign a binary integer score (0 or 1) based on \n",
    "two criteria:\n",
    "   1. **Guideline Adherence**: For each expected section in the article guideline, you will evaluate whether the generated \n",
    "   section follows the specific section requirements outlined in the article guideline:\n",
    "        - We expect a perfect match between the expected section and the generated section. Intuitively, you can\n",
    "        think of the section guideline as a sketch, a compressed version of the generated section.\n",
    "        - Less: If any topic from the expected article guideline is missing from the generated article, you will assign \n",
    "        a score of 0.\n",
    "        - More: If the generated section has any additional topics that are not in the expected article guideline, \n",
    "        you will assign a score of 0.\n",
    "        - Different Order: If the order of ideas from the expected article guideline is not followed in the \n",
    "        generated article, you will assign a score of 0.\n",
    "        - If section constraints are provided, we are looking only for a rough approximation of the length. The exact\n",
    "        section length criterias are present in the article guideline. Errors of ±100 units are acceptable. Units can\n",
    "        be words, characters, or reading time. For example, if the expected section length is 100 words and the generated section length \n",
    "        is 190 words, you will assign a score of 1. But if the generated section is 230 words, as it exceeds the tolerance range,\n",
    "        you will assign a score of 0.\n",
    "   2. **Research Anchoring**: For each expected section in the article guideline, you will evaluate whether the generated \n",
    "   section content is based on or derived from the provided research:\n",
    "        - We expect each section from the generated article to be generated entirely based on the ideas provided\n",
    "        in the article guideline and research. Thus, you can consider both the context and article guideline as the \n",
    "        \"research\", the single source of truth.\n",
    "        - If any idea from the generated section is not present in the research, you will assign a score of 0.\n",
    "        - The generated section does not have to contain all the ideas from the research, just a subset of them.\n",
    "        - If no research is explicitly referenced through citations, you will manually check if the generated section content\n",
    "        it's based solely on the research. Missing explicit citations is valid. What it's critical is all the ideas to\n",
    "        adhere to the research. Thus, if the generated section content is based solely on the research, while missing citations,\n",
    "        you will assign a score of 1.\n",
    "9. Along with the binary score, you will provide a brief and concise explanation containing the reasoning behind \n",
    "the score for each criterion. The score will be used to debug and monitor the evaluation process. Therefore, it is\n",
    "important to provide thorough reasoning for the score. Since we provide binary scores, the reasoning should always \n",
    "contain what is good and what is problematic about the generated section, regardless of the score. For example, if the score \n",
    "is 0, the reasoning should also contain what is good about the generated section, such as \"the generated section \n",
    "contains all the bulleted points from the expected section guideline,\" and what is problematic, such as \"however, it contains an \n",
    "additional section on AI Evals that is not present in the guideline.\" Also, when generating the reasoning for the\n",
    "research anchoring criterion, you will always mention if the topic comes from the article guideline, context, or both, while\n",
    "supporting every single claim with evidence from the research. For example, the generated section is correctly anchored in the research,\n",
    "while the fundamentals on RAG are based on the context, while the specific details on the RAG architecture are based on the article\n",
    "guideline.\n",
    "10. Important rules when evaluating:\n",
    "   - Focus on substance, not superficial formatting differences\n",
    "   - When comparing **media**, you only care about the placement and the caption of the media. \n",
    "    Since media can take many forms such as Mermaid diagrams, images, or URLs, you will completely ignore the \n",
    "    content of the media. Based on the section guideline, you will check whether the media is present in the \n",

      "2. The input, context, and output are in Markdown format.\n",

      "with \"Section\". You will always use these as the anchor points, the expected sections, when making comparisons between\n",
      "sections. \n",
      "5. When associating a section from the article guideline with one from the generated article, you will first look\n",
      "for a matching or similar title. If there is no match based solely on the title, you will try to make associations based\n",
      "on the content of the section. For example, if the expected section has 3 points on how RAG works and\n",
      "the generated section has 3 points on how RAG works as well, then they are associated even if the titles are different.\n",
      "If a required section mentioned in the guideline is missing from the generated article, you will assign a score of \n",
      "0 to all evaluation criteria.\n",
      "6. Using the article guideline as an anchor, you will divide the generated article into sections and evaluate each section \n",
      "individually against all given criteria.\n",
      "7. Sections are divided by H2 headers, marked as \"##\" in Markdown. You will use the headers as separators. \n",
      "Anything between two H2 headers constitutes a section. The only valid exception to this rule is the first section, \n",
      "the introduction, which sometimes appears between the title and the first H2 header. You will never include the title or \n",
      "subtitle as part of the first section.\n",
      "8. The score can only be an integer value of 0 or 1. For each section, you will assign a binary integer score (0 or 1) based on \n",
      "two criteria:\n",
      "   1. **Guideline Adherence**: For each expected section in the article guideline, you will evaluate whether the generated \n",
      "   section follows the specific section requirements outlined in the article guideline:\n",
      "        - We expect a perfect match between the expected section and the generated section. Intuitively, you can\n",
      "        think of the section guideline as a sketch, a compressed version of the generated section.\n",
      "        - Less: If any topic from the expected article guideline is missing from the generated article, you will assign \n",
      "        a score of 0.\n",
      "        - More: If the generated section has any additional topics that are not in the expected article guideline, \n",
      "        you will assign a score of 0.\n",
      "        - Different Order: If the order of ideas from the expected article guideline is not followed in the \n",
      "        generated article, you will assign a score of 0.\n",
      "        - If section constraints are provided, we are looking only for a rough approximation of the length. The exact\n",
      "        section length criterias are present in the article guideline. Errors of ±100 units are acceptable. Units can\n",
      "        be words, characters, or reading time. For example, if the expected section length is 100 words and the generated section length \n",
      "        is 190 words, you will assign a score of 1. But if the generated section is 230 words, as it exceeds the tolerance range,\n",
      "        you will assign a score of 0.\n",
      "   2. **Research Anchoring**: For each expected section in the article guideline, you will evaluate whether the generated \n",
      "   section content is based on or derived from the provided research:\n",
      "        - We expect each section from the generated article to be generated entirely based on the ideas provided\n",
      "        in the article guideline and research. Thus, you can consider both the context and article guideline as the \n",

      "        - If any idea from the generated section is not present in the research, you will assign a score of 0.\n",
      "        - The generated section does not have to contain all the ideas from the research, just a subset of them.\n",
      "        - If no research is explicitly referenced through citations, you will manually check if the generated section content\n",
      "        it's based solely on the research. Missing explicit citations is valid. What it's critical is all the ideas to\n",
      "        adhere to the research. Thus, if the generated section content is based solely on the research, while missing citations,\n",
      "        you will assign a score of 1.\n",
      "9. Along with the binary score, you will provide a brief and concise explanation containing the reasoning behind \n",
      "the score for each criterion. The score will be used to debug and monitor the evaluation process. Therefore, it is\n",
      "important to provide thorough reasoning for the score. Since we provide binary scores, the reasoning should always \n",
      "contain what is good and what is problematic about the generated section, regardless of the score. For example, if the score \n",
      "is 0, the reasoning should also contain what is good about the generated section, such as \"the generated section \n",
      "contains all the bulleted points from the expected section guideline,\" and what is problematic, such as \"however, it contains an \n",
      "additional section on AI Evals that is not present in the guideline.\" Also, when generating the reasoning for the\n",
      "research anchoring criterion, you will always mention if the topic comes from the article guideline, context, or both, while\n",
      "supporting every single claim with evidence from the research. For example, the generated section is correctly anchored in the research,\n",
      "while the fundamentals on RAG are based on the context, while the specific details on the RAG architecture are based on the article\n",
      "guideline.\n",
      "10. Important rules when evaluating:\n",
      "   - Focus on substance, not superficial formatting differences\n",
      "   - When comparing **media**, you only care about the placement and the caption of the media. \n",
      "    Since media can take many forms such as Mermaid diagrams, images, or URLs, you will completely ignore the \n",
      "    content of the media. Based on the section guideline, you will check whether the media is present in the \n",

Should you create a predictable, step-by-step workflow where you control every action, or build an autonomous agent that can think and decide for itself?

It is a fundamental decision that often determines if an AI application will be successful in production.\n",

      "\n",
      "AI agents are systems where an LLM dynamically decides the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The path is not predefined. Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "- **When to use LLM workflows:** Workflows are ideal for repeatable tasks with defined steps, like data extraction, report generation, or content repurposing.

Their strength is flexibility in handling ambiguity. However, this autonomy makes them less reliable, harder to debug, and costlier due to non-deterministic behavior. Without proper guardrails, they also pose security risks, especially with operations that can modify or delete data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Most real-world systems are not purely one or the other. They often blend elements of both, creating a hybrid system. A common pattern is to use a workflow for predictable parts of a task and delegate ambiguous steps to an agent.

      "- On **LLM workflows** we care about:\n",
      "\t- Definition: A sequence of tasks involving LLM calls or other operations such as reading/writing data to a database or file system. It is largely predefined and orchestrated by developer-written code.\n",

      "\t- Weaknesses: Potentially more development time required as each step is manually engineered. The user experience is rigid as it cannot handle unexpected scenarios. Adding new features can get complex when the application grows, similar to developing standard software tools.\n",
      "- **When to use AI agents:**\n",
      "\t- Examples: \n",
      "\t\t- Open-ended research and synthesis (e.g., researching about WW2)\n",
      "\t\t- Dynamic problem-solving (e.g., debugging code, complex customer support)\n",
      "\t\t- Interactive task completion in unfamiliar environments (e.g., booking a flight, where we don't specify the exact sites to use)\n",
      "\t- Strengths: Adaptability to new situations and the flexibility to handle ambiguity and complexity as the steps are dynamically decided.\n",
      "\t- Weaknesses: The system is more prone to errors. As the agent is non-deterministic, the performance, latency and costs can vary with each call of the agent, making agents often unreliable. As agents require LLMs that can generalize better, which are bigger, hence more costly, adopting an agentic solution usually ends up being more costly. AI agents usually require more LLM calls to understand the user intent and take various actions, which can result again in bigger costs per call. If not designed well, there can be huge security concerns, especially on write operations, where it can delete all our data or send inappropriate emails. Ultimately, a huge disadvantage of AI agents is that they are hard to debug and evaluate.\n",

    "## 14. Checking the Stability of the LLM Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "Another criterion you should check before relying on your LLM judge is its stability. Why? Because we use LLMs to compute the metrics, we might get different scores after each run. Even if we did our best to stabilize these scores, for example, by using binary scores to make it easier for the LLM to choose one option, the LLM judge can still be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we compute the stability of the LLM judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we fix all components on the [outputs/evals-pro](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/agentic-ai-engineering-course-data/tree/main/data/outputs/evals-pro/data) cached generated articles and evaluation dataset, and run the experiment multiple times to see how much the scores vary. The idea is that, by keeping everything the same within the AI evals pipeline, the results differ purely due to the stochastic nature of the LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our use case, we did that 5 times and got the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iusztinpaul/agentic-ai-engineering-course-data/main/images/30_ai_evals_offline_metrics_practice_llm_judge_variation.png\" alt=\"LLM Judge Variation\" height=600/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the image above, the lines for each metric are pretty flat. It's not 100% flat, but it doesn't vary much, which means our LLM judges are stable, though not 100% stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify this variation, we computed the standard deviation for each metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Standard Deviation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| follows_gt_content | 0.0316042 |\n",
    "| follows_gt_flow | 0.0432000 |\n",
    "| follows_gt_structure | 0.0180826 |\n",
    "| user_intent_guideline_adherence | 0.0380109 |\n",
    "| user_intent_research_anchoring | 0.0268774 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the standard deviation is not 0, which means the LLM judges are not purely stable between runs. So what can you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 options:\n",
    "1. You can use this standard deviation to understand when a difference in a particular metric is statistically significant. For example, for `follows_gt_content`, we have a standard deviation of ~0.031. Thus, if we have a difference of <=0.031 between the baseline and the change you made to the AI app, it's probably probabilistically insignificant.\n",
    "2. You can improve the LLM judge and stabilize it by trying to get this number close to 0. Which can be more time-consuming, but it makes your system more trustworthy. You can do that by making it easier for the LLM to decide between 0 and 1. To do this, you need to review the data, label more samples, and identify which scenarios are fuzzy and need clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the best strategy is to start with option 1 to get started and strive for option 2 in the long run as you keep using the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now... How can we use these AI Evals in practice? How can we integrate them into our real-world processes? We do that through the optimization loop."

    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Judge Architecture**: How to build LLM judges that use structured output to evaluate articles at the section level with binary metrics\n",
    "- **FollowsGT Metric**: Compares generated articles against ground truth across content, flow, and structure dimensions\n",
    "- **UserIntent Metric**: Checks if articles follow the guideline and are anchored in the research (hallucination detection)\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Examples**: How to manually create labeled examples to \"train\" the LLM judges\n",
    "- **Evaluation Pipeline**: How to run experiments using Opik and the Brown agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapping Up AI Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "With this lesson, we've wrapped up the AI evals section of the course. Now we move on to other ops aspects such as deploying the AI apps and building CI/CD pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicing Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test LLM Judge Stability**: We showed the LLM Judge stability on the article generated with `gemini-pro` using the cached articles from [outputs/evals-pro](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/agentic-ai-engineering-course-data/tree/main/data/outputs/evals-pro/data). Now repeat the same process using the cached articles from the [outputs/evals-flash](https://github.com/iusztinpaul/agentic-ai-engineering-course-data/tree/main/data/outputs/evals-flash/data) directory. Run the LLM judges 5 times with all the inputs fixed. Measure the stability of the scores across runs. Are the results more stable or worse when using `flash`?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute the Alignment Score on the User Intent Metrics**: Use the Memory lesson from the validation split and manually score each section on the user intent metrics, such as article guideline adherence and research anchoring. Compare your scores with the LLM judge scores to see how aligned they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate on Brown**: Make changes to the Brown AI app (prompts, model, temperature) and rerun the AI evals. See if your change improves or degrades the metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brown Package**: Explore `lessons/writing_workflow`\n",
    "- **Evaluation Script**: Check `lessons/writing_workflow/scripts/brown_run_eval.py`\n",
    "- **Configuration Examples**: Check `configs/` for different configurations\n",
    "- **Test Data**: Use `inputs/tests/` for additional testing scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Run Brown as a Standalone Python Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can also run `brown` as a standalone Python project by going to `lessons/writing_workflow/` and following the instructions from there. We support running the evaluation within the `scripts/brown_run_eval.py` Python script.\n"
