    <title>Navigating the Course: Essential Skills vs. FOMO</title>
    <content>Define the course's focus on building integrated agentic systems that can reason, plan, and act. Differentiate the essential, practical skills for an AI Engineer from the "Fear Of Missing Out" (FOMO) topics like training foundation models from scratch. Emphasize that the core of modern AI engineering is practical application and system integration, not deep research.</content>

    <title>The Inevitable Shift to Autonomous Agentic Systems</title>
    <content>Describe the evolution from basic, single-turn LLM interactions to complex, autonomous systems. Define what an "agentic system" is in practical terms—a system that can perceive, make decisions, and act. Introduce advanced reasoning models as the brains and frameworks like LangGraph and the OpenAI Agents SDK as the skeletons for building these stateful, multi-step applications.</content>
