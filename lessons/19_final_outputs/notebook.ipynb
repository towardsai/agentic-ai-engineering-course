      "Okay, so I'm ready to roll. My first step is to lay out this research workflow – gotta make sure we're on the same page and, critically, that I have the right starting point. I need to explain the steps, and then I'll politely ask for that all-important `research_directory`. I'm also going to check if there are any tweaks or modifications you'd like to make to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once that's clear, I'll kick things off by calling `extract_guidelines_urls` to grab the URLs and local files listed in `ARTICLE_GUIDELINE_FILE`. That gives me a solid initial pool to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the heavy lifting begins. I'll launch several parallel processes to handle different types of resources efficiently. I'll call `process_local_files` for local content, `scrape_and_clean_other_urls` for general web pages, `process_github_urls` for those GitHub repositories (always a good source!), and `transcribe_youtube_urls` for any relevant YouTube videos. Parallel processing is key here for speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next comes the core research loop. We'll run this three times, each time generating new search queries with `generate_next_queries`. Those queries will then be fed into `run_perplexity_research` to pull in the initial research results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we filter. I'll use `select_research_sources_to_keep` to identify and keep only the highest-quality sources from the Perplexity results. This is where expertise comes into play – I need to make sure we're focusing on the good stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the good stuff is identified, I'll identify sources for a complete scrape using `select_research_sources_to_scrape`. Then I'll call `scrape_research_urls` to scrape the selected sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll synthesize everything. I'll call `create_research_file` to compile all the research, cleaned content, scraped pages, and initial sources into a comprehensive `research.md` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a critical point: I need to be prepared for potential hiccups. If *any* of the tools run into trouble and successfully process zero items, I'm going to halt the entire process. I'll state which tool failed and the associated error message, and then I'll ask for your guidance on how to proceed.

      "    *   I will execute these queries using Perplexity and save the results.\n",
      "4.  **Filter Perplexity Results**: After the research rounds, I will automatically select high-quality sources from the Perplexity results based on trustworthiness, authority, and relevance.\n",
      "5.  **Scrape Selected Research Sources**: I will identify up to 5 priority research sources from the filtered Perplexity results that deserve a full scrape, and then proceed to scrape their full content.\n",

I explained the workflow, got the research directory, and called `extract_guidelines_urls`. Then, `process_local_files`, `scrape_and_clean_other_urls`, `process_github_urls`, and `transcribe_youtube_urls` have all been executed. The Perplexity research rounds have also completed - three rounds of query generation and subsequent research execution.

I can see that the initial URL extraction went well, and all the resource processing steps (local files, other URLs, GitHub, and YouTube) were executed successfully, with no critical failures. We might have had no local files and no YouTube videos, but that's perfectly fine—the tools handled the absence gracefully.\n",

And the source selection at the end of each round is giving us some good material to work with.\n",

The follow-up steps, 2.1 through 2.4, can run in parallel, and I see that I've already done most of the heavy lifting there.

    "4. Now, you can use the research agent directly within Cursor! Open a new chat in the AI Pane and write `/research-agent` to see the available MCP prompts. You can write `/research-agent/full_research_instructions_prompt` and send it in the chat to start the complete research workflow.\n",
