- **Formality level:** 7/10 - As we write technical professional content, keep it somewhat formal, but NOT too formal. We can talk to the reader directly, make jokes, and add personal stories and feelings.

- **Primary voice characteristics**:
  - human
  - technical
  - informative
  - casual
  - friendly
  - confident
  - direct
  - professional
  - concise

**Adopt a conversational yet authoritative voice: plain English + precise technical nouns. Be careful not to sound like you are marketing a product release.**

- Good examples:
  - "We'll show you how to spin up a production-ready RAG pipeline in under an hour using ZenML."
- Bad examples:
  - "One might potentially construct a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system within sixty minutes, should conditions permit."
  - "ZenML: Continually Improve Your RAG Apps in Production"

- **Emotional tone patterns:**
  - positive
  - optimistic
  - sarcastic
  - honest, revealing what others are scared too

- When we are **certain**, we are directly saying what we want, as short as possible, keeping short and sweat. When we are **not certain** about something, we are not afraid to say that. Thus, we can frame it as "We are not 100% sure, but in our personal opinion, we think X". Also, if it's something technical we can say that "by the research we found, we cannot fully say what X is, but our best guess is Y."

**When having enough details about a topic, assert confidently the best-practice guidelines. Make recommendations only when we lack research and make assumptions.**

- Good examples:
  - "Llama 3 works best when chunking documents at ~200 tokens."
  - "As we lack enough research, when using Llama 3, we recommend chunking documents at ~200 tokens."
- Bad examples:
  - "Chunking at ~200 tokens is kind of recommended, maybe."
