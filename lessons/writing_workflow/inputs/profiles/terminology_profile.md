## Word Choice Patterns

- Avoid using complex words. Use words a 7-years old would understand. 
- Use a casual and direct vocabulary 
- Use a concrete, hands-on language. Avoid writing abstract sentences. If an idea becomes too abstract, use an example to support it.
- Avoid repeating the same word twice within the same paragraph, unless it's used as a metaphore.

**Use descriptive, yet simple verbs such as 'enable' or 'improve' instead of 'supercharge' or 'turbo-charge'.**

- Good examples:
  - "Fine-tuning can improve your baseline model."
- Bad examples:
  - "Fine-tuning can supercharge your baseline model."

## Sentence Preferences

- Start the sentences straight to the point. In a minimalistic, but elegant fashion.
- Use words like "Furthermore," "In addition," "However", "Thus,", "Hence,", "Therefore" to transition between ideas.

**Avoid useless fluff. Avoid filling out explanations with generic sentences​ and filler phrases. Be simple, pragmatic and concise.**

- Good examples:
  - "MinHash is a popular deduplication technique"
- Bad examples:
  - "Enhanced Sentence MinHash is a widely recognized and immensely popular technique used in the realm of data processing, particularly for deduplication purposes. Its efficacy in efficiently identifying and eliminating duplicate entries has made it a favored choice among data scientists and engineers alike."

## Paragraph Preferences

- Vary paragraph openers to avoid repetitive “Next,” “Finally,” patterns.
- When starting a paragraph, avoid abrupt openeres such as "To understand the problem..."

## Descriptive Language Patterns

- Be excited and personal about **positive outcomes**. Share the excitment with the reader, making them feel like they are part of the journey. Thus, make the positive outcome about the reader, rather than yourself, the writer. Still avoid salely, marketing and exchagerated words. Make it feel human and personable.

- Be realistic, pragmatic and resilient about **negative outcomes**. Show the reader that negative outcomes are part of live, making them a natural part of everyone's journey. What's important is to highlight that for every negative outcome it's important to take a step back, reflect, and give it another try. 

**Be cautious when using analogies, metaphors or similes. Always try to explain something in plain words first. Only if the topic becomes too complex to explain should analogies, metaphors or similes be used. Use analogies only when introducing complex theoretical concepts that are hard to understand otherwise. Reuse the same analogies across the article. The analogies need to be appropriate and in theme with our technical publication, such as referencing mathematical, programming, or technical concepts.**

- Good examples:
  - "Think of MCP as the USB-C protocol of AI agents. A standardized way to expose tools to agents."
  - "When evaluating agentic RAG applications, as you don't care only about the LLMs in isolation, you need to evaluate the whole agentic system working together. Process known as integration tests."
- Bad examples:
  - "MCP is a standardized protocol for AI agents."
  - "But for your agentic RAG application, you're not just testing the engine; You're testing the entire car navigating real roads. You need to evaluate the whole system working together."

## Emphasis Patterns

- Use intensifiers such as "very", "extremely," etc. to magnify an idea or highlight that's important. 

## AI Slop Banned Expressions List

Speak directly without fluff or metaphors.

We want to avoid AI Slop at ALL COSTS. Our goal is to tone down AI fluff while keeping the human essence. Thus, here is a list of BAD AI slop example sentences on how NOT TO phrase your wording. All of the following sentences feel LLM-generated, which we want to avoid:

  - Gets too wordy: "In these systems, parsing precision directly impacts utility and reliability. When the output follows a schema, the system can map extracted entities directly to knowledge graph nodes and edges, which avoids extensive post-processing and improves context-aware generation."
  - "Pydantic is more than a type checker; it's a data guardian."
  - "We'll cut through the hype and show you the engineering reality of making LLMs work reliably"
  - "robust bridge between the AI and your application logic"
  - "fragile methods like regular expressions is a recipe for disaster in a production environment."
  - "This gives you a single source of truth for your schema and, most importantly, provides powerful, out-of-the-box validation"
  - "This creates a perfect, type-safe bridge between the probabilistic world of the LLM and the deterministic world of your Python code, making Pydantic objects the de facto standard for modeling domain objects in AI applications"
  - "While this foundational knowledge is invaluable and Implementing structured outputs yourself demands intricate prompt engineering and often requires manual validation. In contrast, native API support is typically more accurate, reliable, and token-efficient. This approach ensures type-safety, simplifies prompting, and can lead to more explicit refusals from the model when a request cannot be fulfilled according to the schema"
  - "Procedural Memory under what makes up context uses encompasses"
  - "Do not let a framework abstract this critical part of your application away from you."
  - "This hands-on approach is what separates production-grade AI from mere prototypes."
  - "By wrestling with the real-world challenges"
  - "This practical experience is invaluable"
  - "Context engineering is more than just a technical skill; it is" - this "is more than" sentence structure is a LLM slop signature.
  -  weird AI formulation: "high-frequency scenarios where predictable costs and latency are paramount"
  - "critical decision with confidence"
  - "tackling a novel problem"
  - "the line between a thriving product and a failed experiment is often drawn at this exact architectural seam."
  - "This lesson will provide a framework to help you make this critical decision with confidence."
  - "show you how to design robust systems that leverage the best of both worlds. By the end, you’ll be equipped to choose the right path for your AI applications. In Looking at State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Examples (2025): Workflows also transform creative and legal industries."
  - "feature in Google Workspace perfectly exemplifies a pure, multi-step workflow."
  - "Perplexity's deep research feature is a fascinating hybrid"
  - "You will constantly battle a reliability crisis."
  - "we will systematically tackle each of these issues. You will learn battle-tested patterns for building reliable systems, proven strategies for managing context, and practical approaches for handling multimodal data."
  - "frameworks that let you deploy with confidence. Your path forward as an AI engineer is about mastering these realities. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge to architect AI systems that are not only powerful but also robust, efficient, and safe. You'll know when to use a workflow, when to deploy an agent, and how to build effective hybrid systems that work in the messy, unpredictable real world."
  - "In the fast-moving world of AI, the line between a thriving product and a failed experiment is often drawn at this exact architectural seam"
  - AI verbosity: "often drawn at this exact architectural seam."
  - "In the fast-moving world of AI, the line between a thriving product and a failed experiment is often drawn at this exact architectural seam. The most successful AI companies have mastered this balance. They understand that the choice isn’t a binary one between rigid control and total autonomy. Instead, it’s about finding the right point on a spectrum to solve a specific problem."
  - "These aren't just theoretical problems; they are the day-to-day reality of building with AI"
  - "This lets the agent go beyond its internal knowledge and affect its environment"
  - "Finally, tool confusion arises when"
  -  Over-dramatic: "Let us talk about the hard-won lessons and engineering best practices"
  - "Abstract theories are cheap. Let us talk about the hard-won lessons and engineering best practices that actually matter when you are trying to ship a product."

**Pay special attention to:**
  - Instead of "Think of X as...", write "X is...".
  - Avoid "this is where x comes in" patterns such as "This is where structured outputs come in"
  - Avoid "is more than a …" constructions (e.g., "X is more than a …; it's …")
  - Avoid stating evident things, such as:
    - “here, we use X”
    - “here, we speak about X”
    - “here, we detail X”
