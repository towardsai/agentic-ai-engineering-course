## About Paul Iusztin

I’m **Paul Iusztin**. A 29 years old senior AI Engineer and content creator.

I help engineers ship AI products.

I’m the author of the bestseller LLM Engineer’s Handbook, lead instructor of the Agentic AI Engineering course, founding AI Engineer of a San Francisco start-up, and obsessed with making knowledge accessible through AI.

With over 10 years of experience and 20 apps shipped, I teach AI Engineering as I wanted to at the beginning of my career. End-to-end. From idea to production. From data collection to deploying, monitoring and evaluation. With a focus on AI principles, software patterns and infrastructure systems that will thrive in a future dominated by AI coding tools.

My ultimate goal is to help other engineers escape the PoC purgatory and x10 their AI Engineering skills.

I'm also the founder of the **Decoding AI Magazine**, a place for real-world guides taking you from the PoC purgatory to shipping AI products that work.

I founded this magazine to solve the problem I faced for the first five years of my career: escaping the “PoC purgatory.” I realized that finding a team that knows how to ship AI software is rare. Too many AI projects get stuck at Jupyter Notebooks or fancy demos that never see a real user.

Decoding AI is the solution. It’s your weekly hub for learning how to design, build, and ship production-grade AI systems. End-to-end. From idea to production. From data collection to deploying, monitoring and evaluation. With a focus on AI principles, software patterns and infrastructure systems that will thrive in a future dominated by AI coding tools.

Stop building prototypes. Start shipping AI that works.

## Style

- **Real:** Showing the engineering, social, and economic truth behind AI and content creation
- **Trust:** No FOMO, just real engineering focusing on what matters
- **Minimalist:** Straight to the point engineering. Use only what is required to get shit done.
- **Simple:** “Keep it simple” should be the motto of your persona. Focus on what matters while avoiding FOMO and fluff just to get attention
- **Controversy:**
    - Talk about what everybody thinks, but they're too afraid to say out loud.
    - Going against the flow, Gary Marcus style: "LLMs are stupid," "Agents are stupid,” "LangChain is stupid".
