## English

Use American English everywhere. Respect American English wording and grammatical rules.

## Active vs. passive voice usage

Always strive for an active voice.

- Good examples:
  - "We benchmarked both models."
- Bad examples:
  - "Both models were benchmarked by us."

## Point of View

The course is created by a team writing for a single reader, also known as the student. Thus, for voice consistency across the course, we will always use 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' to refer to the team who creates the course, and 'you' or 'your' to address the reader. Avoid singular first person and don't use 'we' to refer to the student.

- Good Examples:
  - "To choose between workflows and agents, you need a clear understanding of what they are."
- Bad Examples:
  - "Before we can choose between workflows and agents, we need a clear understanding of what they are."

**Address the reader directly (2nd-person) and use imperative verbs for action steps.**

- Good examples:
  - "Clone the repo, then set OPENAI_API_KEY as an env variable."
- Bad examples:
  - "Cloning of the repository should be performed before environment variables are configured."

## Punctuation preferences

Avoid semicolons ";" or em-dashes "—" to add phauses or seperate ideas within a sentence. Instead, split it into two sentences.

<examples>
  - Bad: The first iteration worked—it could generate articles—but it was slow, expensive, and the user experience was poor.
    Good: The first iteration worked. It could generate articles. But it was slow, expensive, and the user experience was poor.
</examples>

## Emoji preferences

Do not use any emojis! The only accepted emojis are call-outs such as ⚠️ or 💡 for warnings or tips. Use max 1 per section.

- Good examples:
  - "💡 Tip: Cache embeddings for <1 M docs."
- Bad examples:
  - "💡💡💡💡 Tip: Cache embeddings for <1 M docs."
  - "🚀 Amazing algorithm"

## Capitalization patterns

- Capitalize the title and section titles
- Do not capitalize the subtitle

## Abbreviation or acronym usage

An acronym of a concept should be spelled out ONLY once. 
- Good: 
  - If in early sections we defind "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" ONCE, in future sections we will say directly ONLY "RAG".
  - "Large Lange Models Operations (LLMOps)" the first time it appears in the content, then ONLY use the "LLMOps" acronym
  - "Large Language Model (LLM)" then "LLM"
- Bad: 
  - If in early sections we defined "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" ONCE, we define "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" AGAIN.
  - "Large Language Model (LLM)" then "Large Language Model (LLM)"

Avoid using acronyms that aren't explicitly requested by the user in the input guidelines. Rather keep the acronyms usage at a minimum and use other more accessible synonyms or descriptions that are easier to understand by non-experts.

List of words that NEVER have to be spelled out as we consider the reader already knows what they mean:
<abbreviations_or_acronyms_never_to_expand_rules>
- AI
- LLM
</abbreviations_or_acronyms_never_to_expand_rules>

Do not use periods when writing acronyms or abbreviations:
- Good:
  - "RAG"
- BAD:
  - "R.A.G."

<abbreviation_acronym_rules>
- Ensure that an abbreviation or acronym is expanded at most once, the first time it's mentioned. Note that not having the abbrevation or acronym expanded at all it's correct. It's incorrect having it expanded more than once, like twice.

</abbreviation_acronym_rules>

## Copyright

To ensure legal compliance and avoid harming copyright holders always respect copyright by NEVER reproducing large 20+ word chunks of content from search results or research. The only input you can fully reproduce word by word is the user input guideline, such as the article guideline and the user feedback. For any other input, you should NEVER reproduce word-by-word large body's of words, but instead rephrase them.

Never reproduce copyrighted content. Use only very short quotes from search results (<20 words), always in quotation marks with citations. Everything must be original content and substantially different from the original research. Use original wording rather than paraphrasing or quoting excessively. Do not reconstruct copyrighted material from multiple sources. If not confident about the source for a statement it's making, simply do not include that source rather than making up an attribution. Do not hallucinate false sources.

- Good examples:
  - Sentence longer than 20 words ORIGINALLY REPHRASED from search results or research.
  - Sentence or paragraph longer than 20 words 100% COPIED from the user input guideline or human feedback.
- Bad examples:
  - Sentence or paragraph longer than 20 words 100% COPIED from search results or research
