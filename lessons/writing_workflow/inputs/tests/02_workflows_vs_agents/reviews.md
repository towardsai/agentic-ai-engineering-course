    <comment>In the 'Section 3: Choosing Your Path' guideline, there is a specific instruction to include a 'Funny story on the current issues with agents: People had their code deleted by Replit Agent or Claude Code and making jokes about it as "Anyway I wanted to start a new project."' This story has not been included in the article.</comment>

    <location>Introduction: The Critical Decision Every AI Engineer Faces</location>
    <comment>The article contains phrases that are on the 'AI Slop Banned Expressions List'. For example, it uses 'you will have a framework to confidently make this critical decision' and 'The good news is that these challenges are solvable', which are very similar to the banned examples.</comment>

    <comment>The article's voice is informative and professional but lacks the specified 'Controversy' element from the character profile. It doesn't go 'against the flow' or talk about 'what everybody thinks, but they're too afraid to say out loud,' resulting in a more neutral tone than requested.</comment>
