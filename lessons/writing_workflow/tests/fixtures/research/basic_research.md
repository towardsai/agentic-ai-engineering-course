# Research: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Overview
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.

## Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

## Applications
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics

## Future Trends
- Automated machine learning (AutoML)
- Federated learning
- Edge computing integration
