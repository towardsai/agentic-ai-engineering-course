I need to explain the steps, and then I'll politely ask for that all-important `research_directory`. I'm also going to check if there are any tweaks or modifications you'd like to make to the process.\n",

      "Once that's clear, I'll kick things off by calling `extract_guidelines_urls` to grab the URLs and local files listed in `ARTICLE_GUIDELINE_FILE`. That gives me a solid initial pool to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the heavy lifting begins. I'll launch several parallel processes to handle different types of resources efficiently. I'll call `process_local_files` for local content, `scrape_and_clean_other_urls` for general web pages, `process_github_urls` for those GitHub repositories (always a good source!), and `transcribe_youtube_urls` for any relevant YouTube videos. Parallel processing is key here for speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next comes the core research loop. We'll run this three times, each time generating new search queries with `generate_next_queries`. Those queries will then be fed into `run_perplexity_research` to pull in the initial research results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we filter. I'll use `select_research_sources_to_keep` to identify and keep only the highest-quality sources from the Perplexity results. This is where expertise comes into play – I need to make sure we're focusing on the good stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the good stuff is identified, I'll identify sources for a complete scrape using `select_research_sources_to_scrape`. Then I'll call `scrape_research_urls` to scrape the selected sources.\n",

      "Finally, I'll synthesize everything. I'll call `create_research_file` to compile all the research, cleaned content, scraped pages, and initial sources into a comprehensive `research.md` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a critical point: I need to be prepared for potential hiccups. If *any* of the tools run into trouble and successfully process zero items, I'm going to halt the entire process.

I can see that the initial URL extraction went well, and all the resource processing steps (local files, other URLs, GitHub, and YouTube) were executed successfully, with no critical failures. We might have had no local files and no YouTube videos, but that's perfectly fine—the tools handled the absence gracefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iterative research loop is looking solid too. Each of the three rounds went smoothly, with the query generation and Perplexity searches executing as expected. I like that we're generating new queries each time; that's crucial for exploring the topic more broadly. And the source selection at the end of each round is giving us some good material to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final filtering step worked as intended, refining the collection of sources down to a manageable number. It's good to see that the scraping of the selected sources also executed without issues, bringing us closer to having all the primary data we need.\n",

      "So, where are we now? The next and final step is to generate the research file itself. I've done all the preparation, the selection, and the scraping.

      "Okay, so the user's provided the research directory and wants me to run the whole shebang. I've already plowed through step 1.3, which was `extract_guidelines_urls`. Looking at the outputs from that, it was a pretty standard mix: one GitHub source, no YouTube, a good nine web sources, and zilch local files. The follow-up steps, 2.1 through 2.4, can run in parallel, and I see that I've already done most of the heavy lifting there. The `scrape_and_clean_other_urls` tool got most of the web sources, the GitHub tool grabbed the one from there, and, as expected, nothing from YouTube or local files.\n",
