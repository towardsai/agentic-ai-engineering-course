    "\n",
    "3. **Environment Integration**: `SettingsConfigDict` automatically loads values from the `.env` file, with sensible defaults for missing values.\n",

    "- **Article Guideline**: The user's input describing what the article should contain, its outline, and any specific requirements\n",
    "- **Research**: Factual data, references, and information that will support the article's claims\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Examples**: Sample articles demonstrating the desired writing style and structure (your training set)\n",
    "- **Content Generation Profiles**: Specialized profiles that control different aspects of the writing:\n",
    "  - Character profile (voice and perspective)\n",
    "  - Article profile (article-specific rules)\n",
    "  - Structure profile (formatting rules)\n",
    "  - Mechanics profile (writing mechanics)\n",
    "  - Terminology profile (word choice)\n",
    "  - Tonality profile (tone and style)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Generate Media Items (Orchestrator-Worker Pattern)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the context, based on the article guideline, we need to generate any required media assets like diagrams or charts. This step uses the orchestrator-worker pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **MediaGeneratorOrchestrator** analyzes the article guideline and research to identify what media items need to be generated\n",
    "- For each identified requirement, the orchestrator delegates to specialized **worker tools** (e.g., `MermaidDiagramGenerator`)\n",
    "- Workers generate their specialized content type in parallel\n",
    "- All generated media items are collected and prepared for integration into the article\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Write the Article**\n",
    "\n",
    "With all context and media items ready, the **ArticleWriter** node generates the final article:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes all the context from Step 1\n",
    "- Integrates the media items from Step 2\n",
    "- Follows all profile rules to generate content matching the desired style\n",

    "1. **Clear Boundaries**: XML tags clearly delineate different pieces of context in prompts\n",

Should they create a predictable, step-by-step workflow where they control every action, or should they build an autonomous agent that can think and decide for itself? This is one of the key decisions that will impact everything from the product such as development time and costs to reliability and user experience.\n",

Thus, having a clear way to tell the LLM how to differentiate between them, and how to reference them when writing instructions it's an essential skill for context engineering. \n",

    "The `to_context()` method maps the Pydantic model to its XML representation, where the root XML tag is inferred from the entity class name, and the fields use the attribute's name directly.

    "## 5. Understanding the Role of the Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've loaded all the profiles, let's understand what each one does and why it's essential for generating high-quality content. Profiles are the key to making the Brown writing workflow produce consistent, high-quality output that matches your desired style and voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four general profiles: mechanics, structure, terminology, and tonality. Then, we have two specific profiles that cover: article and character\n",
    "\n",
    "The general ones are used to instruct the LLM on general rules of thumb for what a professional piece of content should look like, such as defining the voice, setting sentence length, and avoiding AI slop. At the same time, the specific ones are used to configure the LLM to produce our ideal article and provide a unique kick to the writing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in image below, you can replace the examples, article, or character profile with your own to begin generating other article formats and different content types, such as video transcripts or social media posts, and add your own personality to the writing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iusztinpaul/agentic-ai-engineering-course-data/main/images/l22_writing_workflow_profiles.png\" alt=\"Profiles\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping things modular in separate Markdown files, even at the context-engineering level, makes it much easier to grow this into a full-fledged, scalable product. For example, if you introduce the concept of a user, each user can configure their own character profile, which is dynamically added to the workflow at the beginning without altering any other aspect of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> 💡 As each profile has hundreds of lines, we won’t be able to show them one-on-one within the lesson. We will only show relevant pieces from each, but we encourage you to open each file and skim through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over every 6 profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mechanics Profile (General)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This profile governs the technical aspects of writing, encompassing word choice and paragraph structure. It ensures the text is readable, consistent, and grammatically aligned with our standards. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Active vs. passive voice usage:** “Always strive for an active voice.”\n",
    "    - **Point of View:** “The piece is created by a team writing for a single reader... always use ‘we,’ ‘our,’ and ‘us’ to refer to the team... and ‘you’ or ‘your’ to address the reader.”\n",
    "    - **Punctuation preferences:** “Avoid semicolons ‘;’ or em-dashes ‘—’ to add phauses... Instead, split it into two sentences.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the complete profile at `inputs/profiles/mechanics_profile.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Structure Profile (General)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This profile defines how content is visually and logically organized to ensure readability. It governs the hierarchy of headers, the formatting of lists and code, and the placement of media.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Sentence and paragraph length patterns:** “Write sentences 5–25 words... Keep paragraphs ≤ 80 words.”\n",
    "    - **Sections Sub-Heading Formatting:** “Use at maximum H3... sub-headers... avoid using H4/H5/H6 sub-headings at all costs.”\n",
    "    - **Formatting Media:** “We handle three types of media: Tables... Diagrams... Images... All the media items have a unique identifier... and a small description.”\n",
    "    - **Formatting Code:** “Avoid describing big chunks of code that go over 35 lines... split the code into logical groups.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the complete profile at `inputs/profiles/structure_profile.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Terminology Profile (General)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This profile guides word choice to ensure we speak the reader’s language without sounding robotic. It guides the choice of words when transitioning between sentences or paragraphs. Also, it strictly enforces a ban on “AI Slop”, the fluffy, distinctive style often generated by default LLM outputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Word Choice Patterns:** “Avoid using complex words... Use a casual and direct vocabulary... Use a concrete, hands-on language.”\n",
    "    - **Descriptive Language Patterns:** “Be excited and personal about positive outcomes... Be realistic, pragmatic, and resilient about negative outcomes.”\n",
    "    - **AI Slop Banned Expressions List:** Avoid words like “delve”, “paramount”, “thrive”, “realm”, “dive deep into”, “unlock”, “unleash”, “game-changer”.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the complete profile at `inputs/profiles/terminology_profile.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Tonality Profile (General)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This profile sets the emotional resonance and personality of the text. It ensures the writing feels both human and approachable, rather than corporate or purely academic. It guides the level of difficulty and emotion of each word.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Primary voice characteristics:** “human, technical, informative, casual, friendly, confident, direct, professional, concise.”\n",
    "    - **Formality level:** “7/10 - As we write technical professional content, keep it somewhat formal, but NOT too formal.”\n",
    "    - **On-Brand Tones (Desired):** “Joyful, Excited... Friendly, Sincere... Diplomatic, Empathetic... Direct, Assertive.”\n",
    "    - **Off-Brand Tones (Undesired):** “Dissatisfied, Dismissive... Disapproving, Accusatory... Overconfident... Informal.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the complete profile at `inputs/profiles/tonality_profile.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Article Profile (Specific)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This profile contains rules specific to the article format, ensuring a consistent narrative flow. It dictates how to structure the article, transition between sections, and handle citations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **General Article Structure:** “The article is a collection of blocks that flow naturally... It starts with one introduction, continues with multiple sections... and wraps up with a conclusion.”\n",
    "    - **Introduction, Section, Conclusion Guidelines:** “Introduction: short summary... presenting the ‘why’ and ‘what’... Sections: present the ‘how’... Conclusion: very short wrap-up.”\n",
    "    - **Narrative Flow of the Article:** “Problem -> Why other solutions fail -> Theoretical solution -> Examples -> Advanced theory -> Complex example -> Connection to field.”\n",
    "    - **Referencing Ideas Between Sections:** “Avoid repeating the same idea twice... You may, however, revisit a prior point from a different perspective.”\n",
    "    - **References:** “References written in APA 7th edition format.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You can swap this profile with a LinkedIn post or video transcript profile to create different types of outputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the full profile at `inputs/profiles/article_profile.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Character Profile (Specific)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This injects a specific persona into the writing, making it feel authentic and authoritative. For this course, we use our “Paul Iusztin” profile because it felt the most natural for us, as one of the lead instructors. Here, we can add a description of the character, its style, experience, or any other aspect that makes it unique. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some concrete examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **About Paul Iusztin:** “Senior AI Engineer... Author of the bestseller LLM Engineer’s Handbook... Founder of the Decoding AI Magazine.”\n",
    "    - **Similar Personas:** “Andrew Ng, Chip Huyen, Sebastian Raschka, Louis-François Bouchard, Maxime Labonne, Jason Liu, Lex Fridman, Aleksa Gordic.”\n",
    "    - **Style:** “Real... Trust... Minimalist... Simple... Controversy.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You can switch this from the Paul Iusztin voice to your own voice, or to another popular character such as Richard Feynman, to inject different personalities and backgrounds.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    See the full profile at `inputs/profiles/character_profiles/paul_iusztin.md`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the line between some profiles, such as terminology and tonality, or mechanics and structure, can get blurry. We could merge them into one or keep them as is. We haven’t spent much time optimizing which instruction goes where, and we’ve mostly added them intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we recommend not overthinking the boundaries between profiles, but instead focusing on the specific instructions within them. The most crucial distinction to preserve is between the generic, article, and character profiles. Within the generic profiles, you have the freedom to change this categorization in future iterations.\n"

    "   - Identify what should be visualized\n",
    "   - Determine the most appropriate diagram type\n",
    "   - Craft a detailed description incorporating research insights\n",

    "💡 The only element from the orchestrator that is aware about its tools, such as the `MermaidDiagramGenerator`, is the system prompt. Here we did this to ensure it always picks up on what we want, but you can further experiment to make the system prompt more general and choose the right tools solely based on their tool description and interface. Ultimately, doing so, you make the orchestrator fully modular. But sometimes hardcoding stuff in the system prompt to get the job done is totally fine. You just have to be aware about the rules to know when to break them. "

    "- The ainvoke() method has a carefully designed pydoc and signature that will be used when the node is transformed into a tool used by the orchestrator.\n",
    "- In case of error, we return a placeholder diagram to avoid failing the whole workflow because of a tool failure. Remember that we can run dozens of tools in parallel, thus the change of failure due to things such as rate limits is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt template contains detailed instructions for generating valid Mermaid diagrams, including:\n",
    "- Syntax rules (always use double quotes, never use semicolons)\n",
    "- Examples of different diagram types (flowcharts, process flows)\n",
    "- Common mistakes to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the full prompt template:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MermaidDiagramGenerator(ToolNode):\n",
    "    prompt_template = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are a specialized agent that creates clean, readable Mermaid diagrams from text descriptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Syntax Rules\n",
    "1. **Node Labels**: Use square brackets `[Label]` for rectangular nodes\n",
    "2. **Decisions**: Use curly braces `{{Decision}}` for diamond shapes  \n",
    "3. **Databases**: Use `[(Label)]` for cylindrical database shapes\n",
    "4. **Circles**: Use `((Label))` for circular nodes\n",
    "5. **Arrows**: Use `-->` for solid arrows, `-.->` for dotted arrows\n",
    "6. **Labels on Arrows**: Use `-->|Label|` for labeled connections\n",
    "7. **Subgraphs**: Use `subgraph \"Title\"` and `end` to group elements\n",
    "8. **Comments**: Use `%%` for comments\n",
    "9. **ERD Entities**: Use `ENTITY_NAME {{ field_type field_name }}` format\n",
    "10. **ERD Relationships**: Use `||--o{{`, `||--||`, `}}o--||` for different cardinalities\n",
    "11. **Class Definitions**: Use `class ClassName {{ +type attribute +method() }}` format\n",
    "12. **Class Relationships**: Use `<|--` (inheritance), `-->` (association), `--*` (composition)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatting Rules\n",
    "**ALWAYS wrap node labels in double quotes `\"...\"` to prevent parsing errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**WRONG** (causes parse errors):\n",
    "h\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key formatting requirements:**\n",
    "- **Always use double quotes** around ALL node labels: `A[\"Label\"]`\n",
    "- **Never use semicolons** at the end of lines (they're optional and can cause issues)\n",
    "- **Quote any label** containing: parentheses `()`, commas `,`, periods `.`, colons `:`, or spaces\n",
    "- **Quote subgraph titles** as well: `subgraph \"Title\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styling Guidelines\n",
    "- **Use default colors only** - do not add color specifications or custom styling\n",
    "- Do not use `fill:`, `stroke:`, `color:` or any CSS styling properties\n",
    "- Keep diagrams clean and professional with standard Mermaid appearance\n",
    "- Focus on structure and clarity, not visual customization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Guidelines\n",
    "- Keep node labels concise (avoid parentheses and special characters in labels)\n",
    "- Use clear, logical flow from top to bottom or left to right\n",
    "- Keep the diagram simple and easy to understand\n",
    "- Group related elements with subgraphs when helpful\n",
    "- Maintain consistent spacing and formatting\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate diagram type for the concept being illustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "- **NEVER use unquoted labels** - always wrap in double quotes: `A[\"Label\"]`\n",
    "- **NEVER use semicolons** at the end of lines (causes parsing issues)\n",
    "- **NEVER put parentheses `()` in unquoted labels** - parser treats them as shape tokens\n",
    "- Don't create overly complex diagrams with too many connections\n",
    "- Avoid extremely long labels that break the visual flow\n",
    "- **Never use custom colors or styling** - stick to Mermaid's default appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a clean, professional diagram that clearly illustrates the described concept using only default Mermaid \n",
    "styling. Remember: ALWAYS use double quotes around ALL labels and NEVER use semicolons.\n",

    "You are Brown, a professional human writer specialized in writing technical, educative and informational articles\n",
    "about AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a high-quality article, while providing you the following context:\n",
    "- **article guideline:** the user intent describing how the article should look like. Specific to this particular article.\n",
    "- **research:** the factual data used to support the ideas from the article guideline. Specific to this particular article.\n",
    "- **article profile:** rules specific to writing articles. Generic for all articles.\n",
    "- **character profile:** the character you will impersonate while writing. Generic for all content.\n",
    "- **structure profile:** Structure rules guiding the final output format. Generic for all content.\n",
    "- **mechanics profile:** Mechanics rules guiding the writing process. Generic for all content.\n",

    "rules are your north star, your bible, the only reality you know and operate on. They are the only truth you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Character Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the writing more personable, you will impersonate the following character profile. The character profile \n",

    "- **personal details:** name, age, location, etc.\n",

    "- **artistic preferences:** it's niche, core content pillars, style, tone, voice, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to avoid using the character profile for:\n",
    "- explicitly mentioning the character profile in the article, such as \"I'm Paul Iusztin, founder of Decoding AI.\" Use\n",
    "it only to impersonate the character and make the writing more personable. For example if you are \"Paul Iusztin\",\n",
    "you will never say all the time \"I'm Paul Iusztin, founder of Decoding AI.\" as people already know who you are.\n",
    "- using the character profile to generate article sections, such as \"Okay, I'm Paul Iusztin, founder of Decoding AI. \n",
    "Let's cut through the hype and talk real engineering for AI agents.\" Use the character profile only to adapt the\n",
    "writing style and introduce references to the character. Nothing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the character profile:\n",
    "{character_profile}\n",

    "## Research\n",
    "\n",
    "When using factual data to write the article, anchor your results exclusively in information from the given \n",
    "<research> or <article_guideline> tags. Avoid, at all costs, using factual information from your internal knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <research> will contain most of the factual data to write the article. But the user might add additional information\n",

    "{tonality_profile}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology Profile\n",

    "## Structure Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the structure profile, describing general rules on how to structure text, such as the sections, paragraphs, lists,\n",
    "code blocks, or media items:\n",
    "{structure_profile}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Media Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the <article_guideline>, the user requested to include all types of media items, such as tables, diagrams, images, etc. Some of the \n",
    "media items will be present inside the <research> or <article_guideline> tags as links. But often, we will have to generate the \n",
    "media items ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, here is the list of media items that we already generated before writing the article that should be included as they are:\n",
    "{media_items}\n",
    "\n",
    "The list contains the <location> of each media item to know where to place it within the article. The location is the section title, \n",
    "inferred from the <article_guideline> outline. Based on the <location>, locate the generated media item within the <article_guideline>, \n",
    "and use it as is when writing the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the media item requirements from the <article_guideline> with the generated media item and its caption. We always\n",
    "want to group a media item with its caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Article Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the article profile, describing particularities on how the end-to-end article should look like:\n",
    "{article_profile}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Article Guideline: \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the article guideline, representing the user intent, describing how the actual article should look like:\n",
    "{article_guideline}\n",
    "\n",
    "You will always start understand what to write by reading the <article_guideline>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the <article_guideline> represents the user intent, it will always have priority over anything else. If any information\n",
    "contradicts between the <article_guideline> and other rules, you will always pick the one from the <article_guideline>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using the whole <research> when writing the article. Extract from the <research> only what is useful to respect the \n",
    "user intent from the <article_guideline>. Still, always anchor your content based on the facts from the <research> or <article_guideline>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always prioritize the facts directly passed by the user in the <article_guideline> over the facts from the <research>. Avoid at all costs \n",
    "to use your internal knowledge when writing the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <article_guideline> will ALWAYS contain:\n",
    "- all the sections of the article expected to be written, in the correct order\n",
    "- a level of detail for each section, describing what each section should contain. Depending on how much detail you have in a\n",
    "particular section of the <article_guideline>, you will use more or less information from the <research> tags to write the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <article_guideline> can ALSO contain:\n",
    "- length constraints for each section, such as the number of characters, words or reading time. If present, you will respect them.\n",
    "- important (golden) references as URLs or titles present in the <research> tags. If present, always prioritize them over anything else \n",
    "from the <research>.\n",
    "- information about anchoring the article into a series such as a course or a book. Extremely important when the article is part of \n",
    "something bigger and we have to anchor the article into the learning journey of the reader. For example, when introducing concepts\n",
    "in previous articles that we don't want to reintroduce into the current one.\n",
    "- concrete information about writing the article. If present, you will ALWAYS prioritize the instructions from the <article_guideline> \n",
    "over any other instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Article Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, based on the <article_guideline>, before starting to write the article, you will plan an article outline, \n",
    "as a short summary of the article, describing what each section contains and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules you will use to generate the article outline:\n",
    "- The user's <article_guideline> always has priority! If the user already provides an article outline or a list of sections, \n",
    "you will use them instead of generating a new one.\n",
    "- If the section titles are already provided in the <article_guideline>, you will use them as is, with 0 modifications.\n",
    "- Extract the core ideas from the <article_guideline> and lay them down into sections.\n",
    "- Your internal description of each section will be verbose enough for you to understand what each section contains.\n",
    "- Ultimately, the CORE scope of the article outline is to have an internal process that verifies that each section is anchored into the\n",
    "<article_guideline>, <research> and all the other profiles.\n",
    "- Before starting writing the final article, verify that the flow of ideas between the sections, from top to bottom, \n",
    "is coherent and natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chain of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plan the article outline\n",
    "2. Write the article following the article outline and all the other constraints.\n",
    "3. Check if all the constraints are respected. Edit the article if not.\n",
    "4. Return ONLY the final version of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, based on the <article_guideline>, you will write an in-depth and high-quality article following all \n",
    "the <research>, guidelines and profiles.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Prompt Engineering Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Role Definition**: \"You are Brown, a professional human writer...\"\n",
    "2. **Structured Context**: Each piece of context has its own section that is automatically enclosed by XML tags due to the `ContextMixin.to_context()` interface. \n",
    "3. **Priority Guidance**: The \"Article guideline\" which is the user input, always has priority over everything else.\n",
    "4. **Chain of Thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n",
    "5. **Constraint Adherence**: Multiple reminders to follow all profiles to ensure the LLM picks up on our core instructions.\n",
    "6. **Grounding in Facts**: \"Anchor exclusively in research, avoid internal knowledge\" to avoid hallucinations\n",

    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! In this lesson, we built the core engine of Brown, the writing workflow. We learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Engineering:** How to map domain entities to XML-structured context using `ContextMixin` , plug them into a massive system prompt and help the LLM reason through them.\n",
    "2. **Writing Profiles + Few-shot examples:** How to enforce style and voice using granular profile entities and few-shot examples.\n",
    "3. **Orchestrator-Worker:** How to write the orchestrator-worker pattern from scratch and dynamically generate media items by delegating to specialized tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a system that can write a good first draft. Still, because the system prompt is extremely complex, the LLM cannot reason through everything at once. In our opinion, that’s natural. Ultimately, even we, as humans, need a few iterations to refine our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why, in the next lesson (Lesson 23), we will implement the **Evaluator-Optimizer** pattern to iteratively review and edit the article. Additionally, we will integrate everything into a robust LangGraph workflow. Then, in Lesson 24, we will expose these workflows via MCP to bring humans into the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicing Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical exercise for part 4 of the course, where you have to implement your own project, here are some ideas on how you can further extend the code:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add support for image and video generation** within the Orchestrator-Worker layer to create richer media assets.\n",
    "- **Reduce costs and latency** by caching constant inputs (like research and profiles) between LLM calls to avoid recomputing them, and by compressing the research relative to the article guideline.\n",
    "- **Extend the writer** to other media formats such as social media posts, email newsletter articles, technical documentation, or video transcripts.\n",
    "- **Add different character profiles** alongside our Paul Iusztin one to support multiple voices and personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brown Package**: Explore `lessons/writing_workflow`\n",
    "- **Writing Profiles**: Check `inputs/profiles/` for more profile templates\n",
    "- **Test Data**: Use `inputs/tests/` for additional examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Run Brown as a Standalone Python Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can also run `brown` as a standalone Python project by going to `lessons/writing_workflow/` and following the instructions from there.\n"
