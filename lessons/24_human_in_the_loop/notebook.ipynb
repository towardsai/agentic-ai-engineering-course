    "1. We can use a low number of review loops during initial article generation to reduce costs and latency\n",
    "2. After reviewing the generated article, we can dynamically run additional review and editing workflows with human feedback\n",

    "\n",
    "### Decoupling Workflows with MCP\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `generate_article` workflow is one independent MCP tool\n",
    "- The `edit_article` workflow is another independent MCP tool\n",
    "- The `edit_selected_text` workflow is a third independent MCP tool\n",

Think of it like a recipe where each step is explicitly defined. The key characteristic is that the path is determined in advance, resulting in a deterministic or rule-based system. This gives you predictable execution, explicit control over the application's flow, and makes the system easier to test and debug. Because you control every step, you know exactly where a failure occurred and how to fix it.\n",

      "\n",
      "AI agents are systems where an LLM dynamically decides the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The path is not predefined. Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "### How to choose between predictable control and autonomous flexibility when building AI applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every AI engineer faces a core architectural dilemma: build a predictable, step-by-step workflow, or create an autonomous agent that thinks and decides for itself? This choice impacts development time, costs, reliability, and user experience. It is a decision that shapes the success of an AI application in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lesson will help you understand the differences between LLM workflows and AI agents, know when to use each, and learn how to combine their strengths in hybrid approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understanding the Spectrum: From Workflows to Agents\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the right choice, you first need to understand what LLM workflows and AI agents are. We will look at their core properties and how they are used, rather than their technical specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### LLM Workflows\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks orchestrated by developer-written code. It can include LLM calls, but also other operations like reading from a database or calling an API. For example, a workflow might take a user query, retrieve relevant documents from a database, summarize them with an LLM, and then send the summary to the user. The path is determined in advance, resulting in a deterministic or rule-based system. This gives you predictable execution, explicit control over the application's flow, and makes the system easier to test and debug. You know exactly where a failure occurred and how to fix it.\n",

      "graph TD\n",
      "    A[\"Start\"] --> B[\"LLM Call\"]\n",
      "    B --> C[\"Process Data\"]\n",
      "    C --> D[\"Store Data\"]\n",
      "    D --> E[\"End\"]\n",
      "```\n",
      "Image 1: A flowchart illustrating a deterministic LLM workflow with clear start and end points, including an LLM call and data operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### AI Agents\n",
      "\n",
      "AI agents are systems where an LLM dynamically decides the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The path is not predefined. Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe).\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, an agent tasked with booking a flight might first search for available flights, then check prices, and finally present options to the user, adapting its steps if a flight is unavailable or too expensive. This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "## Choosing Your Path\n",
      "\n",
      "The core difference between these two approaches lies in a single trade-off: developer-defined logic versus LLM-driven autonomy [[2]](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/llmops-for-production-agentic-rag), [[3]](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-developers-guide-to-building-scalable-ai-workflows-vs-agents/).

      "\n",
      "### When to use LLM workflows\n",
      "\n",
      "Workflows are ideal for repeatable tasks with defined steps. This includes pipelines for data extraction and transformation from sources like the web, Slack, Zoom calls, Notion, and Google Drive. They are also great for automated report or email generation from multiple data sources, repetitive daily tasks such as sending emails or posting social media updates, and content generation or repurposing, like transforming articles into social media posts. Their strength is predictability, ensuring reliable results, easier debugging, and lower costs by using specialized models. The main weakness is rigidity; they cannot handle unexpected scenarios, and adding features can become complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "### When to use AI agents\n",
      "\n",
      "Agents excel at dynamic problem-solving. This includes open-ended research and synthesis, such as researching about World War II, dynamic problem-solving like debugging code or complex customer support, and interactive task completion in unfamiliar environments, like booking a flight without specifying exact sites. Their strength is flexibility in handling ambiguity. However, this autonomy makes them more prone to errors. Agents are non-deterministic, so performance, latency, and costs can vary with each call, making them unreliable. They require larger LLMs that generalize better, which are more costly. Agents also often need more LLM calls to understand user intent and take actions, increasing costs per call. If not designed well, there can be huge security concerns, especially with write operations, where an agent could delete data or send inappropriate emails. Ultimately, agents are hard to debug and evaluate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hybrid Approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Most real-world systems are not purely one or the other. They often blend elements of both, creating a hybrid system. In reality, we have a spectrum, a gradient between LLM workflows and AI agents, where a system adopts what is best from both worlds depending on its use cases. A common pattern is to use a workflow for predictable parts of a task and delegate ambiguous steps to an agent. For example, a system might use a human-in-the-loop workflow, where the agent proposes an action, and a human verifies it before execution.\n",

      "## The Challenges of Every AI Engineer\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the spectrum from LLM workflows to AI agents is a core part of AI engineering. This choice helps determine if your application will succeed in production. Building AI systems means addressing recurring challenges daily. These include data integration, where you build pipelines to pull information from Slack, web APIs, SQL databases, and data lakes, ensuring only high-quality data reaches your AI system. Another challenge is the cost-performance trap, where sophisticated agents deliver impressive results but cost a lot per user interaction, making them economically unfeasible for many applications. Finally, security concerns arise when autonomous agents with powerful write permissions could send wrong emails, delete critical files, or expose sensitive data.\n",

      "### LLM Workflows\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks orchestrated by developer-written code. It can include LLM calls, but also other operations like reading from a database or calling an API. Think of it like a recipe where each step is explicitly defined. The key characteristic is that the path is determined in advance, resulting in a deterministic or rule-based system. This gives you predictable execution, explicit control over the application's flow, and makes the system easier to test and debug. Because you control every step, you know exactly where a failure occurred and how to fix it.\n",

      "\n",
      "AI agents are systems where an LLM dynamically decides the sequence of steps, reasoning, and actions to achieve a goal. The path is not predefined. Instead, the agent uses a reasoning process to plan its actions based on the task and the current state of its environment. This process is often modeled on frameworks like ReAct (Reason, Act, Observe). This allows agents to be adaptive and capable of handling new or unexpected situations through LLM-driven autonomy. They can select tools, execute actions, evaluate the outcomes, and correct their course until the goal is achieved [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQxr-uOxw2o&t=1s).\n",

      "### LLM Workflows\n",
      "\n",
      "An LLM workflow is a sequence of tasks orchestrated by developer-written code. It can involve LLM calls, reading from databases, or calling APIs. Each step is explicitly defined, like a detailed recipe.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "Brown includes a command-line interface that lets you interact with the MCP server directly from your terminal. This is useful for scripting, automation, and quick testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI script is located at `lessons/writing_workflow/scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py` and provides three main commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **generate-article**: Generate an article from scratch\n",
    "2. **edit-article**: Edit an entire article based on human feedback\n",
    "3. **edit-selected-text**: Edit a selected section of an article\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ You can run these only from the Brown standalone project from `lessons/writing_workflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the CLI commands look like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Generate an article\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py generate-article --dir-path /path/to/article\n",
    "\n",
    "# Edit an entire article\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py edit-article \\\n",
    "    --dir-path /path/to/article \\\n",
    "    --human-feedback \"Make the introduction more engaging\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Edit selected text\n",
    "python scripts/brown_mcp_cli.py edit-selected-text \\\n",
    "    --dir-path /path/to/article \\\n",
    "    --human-feedback \"Make this shorter. Remove all em-dashes.\" \\\n",
    "    --first-line 10 \\\n",
    "    --last-line 20\n",

    "### 8.2 The Brown + Human-in-the-Loop Writing Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "With Brown integrated into Cursor, your writing workflow becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Initial Article**: Use the `generate_article` tool or prompt to create a first draft\n",
    "2. **Review as Human Expert**: Read through the generated article with your domain expertise\n",
    "3. **Provide Feedback**: Select sections that need improvement and provide specific feedback\n",
    "4. **AI Edits**: Use `edit_article` or `edit_selected_text` tools to refine based on your feedback\n",
    "5. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 2-4 until satisfied with the article\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a collaborative experience where:\n",
    "- AI handles the heavy lifting of writing and editing\n",
    "- You guide the direction with your expertise and feedback\n",
    "- The workflow is fast and iterative\n",
    "- You maintain full control over the final output\n",

    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Human-in-the-Loop**: We learned how to design AI workflows that balance automation with human expertise, allowing AI to handle heavy lifting while keeping humans in control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edit Article Workflow**: We implemented the `edit_article` workflow that reviews and edits entire articles based on human feedback and expected requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edit Selected Text Workflow**: We built the `edit_selected_text` workflow for precise, focused edits on specific article sections\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MCP Server**: We served Brown as an MCP server with tools, prompts, and resources while respecting clean architecture principles\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cursor Integration**: We learned how to integrate Brown with Cursor to create a coding-like writing experience with human-in-the-loop editing\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we can use a low number of review loops during initial article generation, then dynamically run additional editing workflows with human feedback when necessary. This approach is both efficient and effective."

    "### Future Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways you can extend Brown to fit your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hook Brown to Claude Desktop**: Instead of using Cursor, integrate Brown with Claude Desktop for a different AI assistant experience\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Resource Templates** to parameterize the writing profiles and easily add support for all the available profiles. [More here](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources#resource-templates).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Serve Brown through FastAPI**: Replace the MCP server with a FastAPI REST API for web-based integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Guideline Review Tool**: Create a workflow to review and edit your article guidelines themselves, helping you refine your inputs"
